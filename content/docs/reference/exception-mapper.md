Together with [providers](/docs/reference/providers.html) `Exception mappers` are a way to override the APIO Architect runtime.

`Excption mappers` allow you to automatically convert exception of your domain like `NoSuchUserException`, `NotAuthenticatedException` into HTTP domain exceptions, with its related status code.

Creating a exception mapper requires to implements the `ExceptionMapper` interface, that has a generic parameter to indicate the exception type. This interface has a sole method `map` which receives the exception and returns an `APIError`. APIO Architect will use the `APIError` instance to serialize the response in the correspondent format.


A simple example would be like this:


```java
public class NotFoundExceptionMapper implements ExceptionMapper<NoSuchModelException> {
	
	@Override
	public APIError map(NoSuchMethodException exception) {
		return new APIError(exception, "Not Found", "not-found", 404);
	}
}
```

Now, everytime one of your [actions](/docs/reference/actions.html) throw a `NoSuchModelException` APIO Architect will convert your exception using the converter and it will return a response nicely formatted.
